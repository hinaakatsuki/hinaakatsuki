#Shortly about myself
studied at school
computer science at my school was weak and I wanted to learn something new

That's why I decided to enter the STEP Academy
and I successfully studied there, albeit for 1 year, but it was the most intense year)

then started working as a freelancer *Sometimes*
and so the main place of activity is the chief administrator
and sometimes you have to look for bugs, etc.
+ self-development

I was delighted when they told me that here we will study python and so on.
and at the same time remember lost skills)
